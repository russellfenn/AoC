# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Puzzles.

## Resources

### Real Python

[Real Python](https://realpython.com) article on the [AoC](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/)

It mentions using the `-k` keyword flag - by naming tests `test_part1_foo` and `test_part2_bar`, you can run only the part2 tests with `pytest -k part2`.

### Git Commit Messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a simple specification for writing consistent commit messages.

## Puzzle Patterns

As I solve and get stuck on more puzzles, I see that they often follow patterns, such as "grid" or "state machine". Seems useful to maintain an index grouping similar puzzles.
